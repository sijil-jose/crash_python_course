# Crash Python Course

This repository collects material for the course held in SISSA for 1st year PhD students of the Astrophysics & Cosmology sector.

## Content

- [lectures](lectures) is a directory containing notebooks and materials used for python lectures (starting from Lec3)
- [exercise0_bash](exercise0_bash) is a walkthrough to better understand bash scripts and batches.
- [exercise1_bash](exercise1_bash) is an assignment in which students have to produce a script for renaming a given collection of files.
- [exercise2_git](exercise2_git) contains instructions to solve the second assignment, in which students should co-operate on the development of a git repository.
- [exercise3_pythonbasics](exercise3_pythonbasics) contains the exercises for the 3rd assignment, in which students should solve some simple mathematical problems by writing python functions and scripts/programs.
- [exercise4_classes](exercise4_classes) contains the text of the last exercise. The assignment wraps up lot (if not everything) we have learned during the lectures and is supposed to push you a bit further.

> Solutions of exercises (except to ex2 which explicitly requires to create a new repo) can be uploaded directly to your fork of this repository. Try to keep the repo tidy though, you can make a sub-directory in each excercise directory called `solution` or you can make a `solutions` directory from the root of the repository, your choice.

## Useful links:

- Go [at this link](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/) to find the installers and instructions to get and set-up Miniconda3 on your system.
- The [conda cheat sheet](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/_downloads/843d9e0198f2a193a3484886fa28163c/conda-cheatsheet.pdf) is very useful and sufficient for most of the questions that might arise.
