## Exercise 3.1 
The check_divisibility fucntion takes two integers as arguments and checks if the first integers is divisible by the second ( or vice versa when reverse = True ) by checking if the reminder of divison = 0. 

case_1 : Writing a program that reads an integer given as input from the user and determines whether it is divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7.

case_2 :Encapsulate the check into a function taking as input two numbers, and write a program that asks the user to insert two numbers and checks whether the first is divisible by the other one (and vice-versa).

## Exercise 3.2
A function that calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to the n-th term by sequentially adding the ultimate and penultimate entries to generate the next entry of list.

I have incorporated some tests (obvious from the name of the methods) using the python unittest package

## Exercise 3.4
A python program that finds the list of prime integer numbers smaller than 100, starting by knowing that 2 is a prime number. here I have implemented the sieve of sundaram algorithm, an O(nlogn) complexity algorithm removing the non prime numbers under maximum integer. [Sieve of Sundaram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Sundaram) . 
I have also implemented the tests for this function using the python unittest package. ( the tests are obvious from the names of the methods)
