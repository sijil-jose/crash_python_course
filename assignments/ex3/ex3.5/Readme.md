## Exercise 3.5
A python module that finds the decomposition in prime factors of a positive integer number. 
The prime factors are found out by hcecking the divisibility of the number by 2 untill its no longer divisible by 2 ie.becomes an odd number and the checking the divisiblity with all the odd numbers starting from 3 to $\sqrt{n}$ and storing all the factors in a list. 

another python file that imports the prime_factors module is written for carrying out the test. the test carried out for all the numbers from 1 to 100 by  checking if the product of prime factors is equal to the given number. and if every factor is a prime number. [ implement the last part of the test ]
