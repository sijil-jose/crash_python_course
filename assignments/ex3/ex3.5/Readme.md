## Exercise 3.5
A python module that finds the decomposition in prime factors of a positive integer number. 
The prime factors are found out by hcecking the divisibility of the number by 2 untill its no longer divisible by 2 ie.becomes an odd number and the checking the divisiblity with all the odd numbers starting from 3 to \sqrt n and storing all the factors in a list.
